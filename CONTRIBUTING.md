# Contributions
There are many ways to contribute to this project. Whether it be a spelling mistake, adding new features, or improving the code, you are welcome to contribute. However, there are standards.

- Do not intentionally add obfuscated code.
- The code must be easily readable. No one-liners. This is not golf.
- You must follow the existing coding style and conventions. Yes, you must use tabs, at the width of 4 spaces, when indenting. I am that evil.
- Provide clear comments on what the code does.
- Provide a clear description when you commit.
- Always test on your end before committing.

By contributing, you are aware that this is voluntary.
